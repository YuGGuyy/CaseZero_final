  description:
    'A violent storm isolates Blackwood Manor from the surrounding village. Shortly before midnight, Lord Reginald Blackwood is discovered dead inside his study, its heavy door bolted from within. The shutters remain latched. There is no obvious route by which an intruder could have escaped. His newly signed will has disappeared.',
  briefing:
    "At 23:55 on an October night in 1898, servants forced open Lord Reginald Blackwood's study after he failed to answer the midnight bell.\n\nHe was dead at his desk. The bolt had been secured from inside. Both window shutters were latched. His final will, signed earlier that evening, could not be found.\n\nThe storm has washed out the manor road, leaving six people trapped under one roof.\n\nThe household agrees on almost nothing about the last two hours. One account places the physician in the east corridor. Another places the solicitor in the library. The grandfather clock stopped at 22:17, yet its mechanism appears undamaged.\n\nYour task is to reconstruct the last evening, locate the missing will, expose any deliberate deception, and establish who is responsible for what happened.",

He had discovered that the revised will would trigger an audit of the funds he had diverted. During his visit before the study was locked, he tampered with the night's cordial and removed the new will. Reginald later secured the study himself. Pike stopped the grandfather clock to create a false time of death and confuse the reconstruction of the final hours. The room was genuinely locked from within. The deception relied on the assumption that the person responsible must have escaped after the bolt was engaged. The will is recovered, the estate fraud is exposed, and Pike is brought to justice.",

The signed will is produced. The Blackwood estate passes to its rightful trustees."
